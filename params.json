Project \"sub-project\" is a project you add yourself, if you \r\n       want.\r\n    2. Project \"etsy\" is a RemoteWebDriver JUnit test-suite using\r\n       a local Grid server that is capable of running multiple \r\n       threads of single-window web browser tests.\r\n    3. Project \"parallelwindows\" is a test of a  multi-window and\r\n       multi-threaded run using a static local website.\r\n    4. Project \"commonlib\" is a sub-project containing methods \r\n       shared between projects.\r\n\r\n# SubProjects\r\nLinks to example sub-projects that belong to this project:\r\n\r\n[ParallelWebDriver](https://github.com/djangofan/selenium-gradle-example/tree/master/parallelwindows)\r\n\r\n[Etsy](https://github.com/djangofan/selenium-gradle-example/tree/master/etsy)\r\n\r\n# Quick Start\r\nNormally, this project would be ran through the Gradle plugin for Eclipse IDE, but I have tried to make it easier \r\nby including a method to run dynamically and directly from the .zip distribution on the command line.\r\n\r\nTo try this project without requiring a Java IDE, just make sure you download Gradle 1.7+, configure your \r\nGRADLE_HOME environment variable, add %GRADLE_HOME%\\bin to your PATH, and then download the .zip distribution\r\nof this project, unzip it, and run the included <b>runProjectMenu.bat</b> script.\r\n\r\n# Implemented Features\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Feature</th>\r\n    <th>Description</th>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>JUnit based</th>\r\n    <td>For use ONLY with JUnit 4.11 or higher because of the usage of the parameterized capability of JUnit. \r\n    This dependency is configured by the Gradle build script.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n    <th>Parallel runner<br/>using JUnit</th>\r\n    <td>A parallel runner using the Gradle maxParallelForks method.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <th>Native automation support</th>\r\n    <td>For use with Sikuli 1.0.1 or higher to test native elements that WebDriver \"Action\" is unable to \r\n    control.

Using the \"Eclipse Marketplace\" settings panel under the \r\n       Eclipse \"Help\" menu, install the Gradle tooling \r\n       functionality.  You can do it through the \"Install New\r\n       Software\" menu, but it isn't recommended.  If Market is\r\n       missing from your Eclipse, then add the repo:\r\n       http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler\r\n       and then install the \"market\" and restart Eclipse.\r\n    2. Download the .zip archive of this GitHub project \r\n       distribution and unzip it to your workspace.  An example:\r\n       \"C:\\Eclipse32\\workspace\\selenium-gradle-example\\\" .\r\n    3. Use the Eclipse \"Import\" function from the Eclipse \"File\r\n       menu\" to import a \"Project\" of type \"Gradle\".\r\n    4. Browse using the import wizard to your projects \"root\" \r\n       directory.  Then click the \"Build model\" button.\r\n    5. Check all checkboxes .  You could also choose to add all \r\n       to your \"working set\" if you like but it isn't required.\r\n    6. Rebuild the dependencies by right clicking on the project\r\n       and then choose Gradle-->Refresh All Dependencies\r\n    7. Right click on your project and choose \"Run As-->External\r\n       Tools Configuration\".  Configure a new \"clean\" and \"build\"\r\n       configuration for running a sub-project (or whatever tasks\r\n       you want to execute).\r\n    8. Optionally, you can run this project on the command line\r\n       with something like \"gradle etsy:clean etsy:runTask --info\" \r\n       and it will execute the project unit tests.  Also, this \r\n       project provides a .bat batch script that does this and\r\n       provides a menu of other actions you can execute, including \r\n       running the \"Gradle GUI\".\r\n\r\n#### IntelliJ-IDEA\r\nThe required Gradle functionality is already built into IntelliJ-IDEA 12.1+ .  I think using IDEA is more difficult\r\nbut go ahead if you are familiar with it.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\nWebsite of this project:<br/>\r\nhttp://djangofan.github.com/selenium-gradle-example/<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n\r\n    1. If the intellisense in Eclipse doesn't work, make sure you \r\n       have added all the .class directories to your Eclipse project\r\n       classpath.  (See the included .classpath file.)\r\n    2. I use \"GitHub GUI\" to sync my local project repo to GitHub. \r\n       If you fork my project, I would recommend doing it this way\r\n       unless you are a Git expert and prefer another way.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
